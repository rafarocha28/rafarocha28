### Hi there 👋

My name is Rafael Rocha and I'm from Brazil. I started working as a developer in 2011 and I have experience in few programming languages and frameworks such as C#, NodeJS, Javascript, React, React Native and Delphi. I'm always trying to learn new and exciting things and I'm always up for some serious hard work.
